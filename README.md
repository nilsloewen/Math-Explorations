# Math-Explorations
Java programs I wrote in first semester Computer Science. After forgetting to bring a calculator to my Math test, I realized I had no idea how to find a square root by hand. This caught my interest because of the idea: "You don't understand something until you can teach it". So I challenged myself to actually understand these calulator tasks we take for granted.
